# Jira SCRUM – default Team for new issues

When creating or updating Jira issues in project **SCRUM** (radiantsystem Atlassian), set the **Team** field so issues appear on the board.

- **Team ID:** `896597de-770a-4ecf-925c-c8706d22b7a7`
- **Team name:** StarTeam
- **Jira field:** `customfield_10001`
- **Source:** Copied from existing ticket SCRUM-10

When using the Jira MCP to create issues (e.g. `createJiraIssue`), include in `additional_fields`:

```json
"additional_fields": { "customfield_10001": { "id": "896597de-770a-4ecf-925c-c8706d22b7a7" } }
```

If the API accepts a different format for the Team field, use the format that matches SCRUM-10’s `customfield_10001`. See `docs/JIRA-BOARD.md` for the same reference.
